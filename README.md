# K-Means-Clustering-Project
For this project we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.  When using the Kmeans algorithm under normal circumstances, it is because we don't have labels. In this case we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed, but we won't usually do this for Kmeans, so the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project, don't truly make sense in a real world setting!.
